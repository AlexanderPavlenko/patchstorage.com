Arturia & Novation LED Controller Helper (ANLCHelper)

This Mozaic script allows you to set up the LED pads on your MIDI controller keyboard to do useful tricks:
- select the color to show when a pad is active / inactive
- work pads as toggles or as momentary switches
- group pads as independent switches or permitting only one pad per group to be turned on
- set up pads to emit notes or CC events on configurable MIDI channels
- assign the CC numbers sent by the knobs on your MIDI keyboard
- switch between different sets of these configurations altogether

This is a genericised modification of LaunchKeyHelper by Espiegel123:
     https://patchstorage.com/launchkey-helper/
and it is still work in progress as it does not change any the original functionality, rather
it only adapts it to additional entry-level keyboards.


The script can be immediately configured to work in AUM with the following entry-level MIDI controller keyboards:

* Novation LaunchKey Mini Mk2
* Novation LaunchKey Mini Mk3
* Arturia MiniLab Mk2


1. Setting up your Keyboard and Mozaic in AUM

(1) Start Mozaic in AUM and load the script ANLCHelper

First time set up for your MIDI keyboard:
       Click on CODE (below the UI)
       Edit in the version of the Midi keyboard you use:
        
       tap on UPLOAD button and  SHOW GUI
       SAVE the script with your change for future use


(2) Configure the connection to your keyboard in AUM:

Setup for LaunchKey Mini Mk2: 
    * MIDI Setup in AUM:
    Mini DAW Port -> Mozaic  -*-> (ch1)Mini DAW Port
                              |
                              *-> (not ch1) your apps / Midi-Ctrl
    You can use e.g. StreamByter to filter channels

Setup for LaunchKey Mini Mk3:  
    * you must start in default mode (MIDI, drum pads) - e.g. you can unplug and replug USB
    * MIDI Setup in AUM:
    Mini DAW Port -> Mozaic  -*-> (ch10) Mini DAW Port
                              |
                              *-> (not ch10) your apps / Midi-Ctrl
    You can use e.g. StreamByter to filter channels.
     Does _not_ use the DAW mode!


   Setup for Arturia MiniLab Mk3 keyboard:  
     * you first _must_ select one of the (original) presets 2-7:  Shift + pad 2 to 7
        The default preset 1 will _not_ work, nor will any preset that you have already customized.
     * MIDI Setup in AUM:
     Arturia Port -> Mozaic  -*-> Arturia Port (sysex messages)
                             |
                             *-> your apps / Midi-Ctrl
 


2. Configuring PAD Behavior

The script supports multiple Configuration Sets. 
Note that each Mozaic screen title shows the number of the Configuration Set:

    ...  -- Config #1

Be aware of the Configuration Set in use.  You find a description below on how to change between them.

Each Configuration Set has four different screens. Each screen will be described in turn.
Hit the small black on-screen  [SHIFT] button when you want to get to the next screen.


Screen 1:  MAIN: Controller Pads

This is the first screen that opens up.
This screen MUST be used to operate the configured pads and controller knobs per the Configuration Set selected.

You see two knobs on this screen. Typically, you can ignore these for now. 
[[ You use them to work with multiple configuration sets:
     'NavOff' - turn this right to 'NavOn' to be able to navigate to other Configuration Sets with:
                       on Mini Mk2: use the round buttons, 
                       on Mini Mk3: use the '<' and 'Stop Solo Mute' buttons
                       on Arturia: use the 'click' on the rotary knobs 1 and 8.
      'Pages:' - set the maximum number of configuration sets (up to four). ]]

The next three screens are used to customize this Configuration Set.

[[ To immediately jump back to this 'MAIN: Controller Pads' screen from any customization screen:
       * on Mini Mk2: hit the '^' (scene up) button
       * on Mini Mk3: hit the  Shift+'>'  key combo
       * on Arturia: not supported. ]]


Screen:  GROUP Settings -- Hold Pad to Edit

Here you configure up to 8 'Groups Of Pads' on-screen. 
The Groups describe common pad behavior with respect to colors, behavior as a group, midi channel, etc.

Push and hold the upper pad for one of the Groups and use the on-screen knobs to adjust:
* the foreground color
* the mode:
   - independent mode: each pad in the Group operates independently
   - group mode: when a pad is selected in the Group, all others are turned off
   - keys mode: pads in this Group are set to momentary behavior ( offMessage=-1 and SendUp: 1 ) 
       ??? better explanation ???
* retrigger applies to 'group mode' only,  i.e. where only one pad is on. Example: clip launcher
     - set to 1:  pad will re-trigger (for example, on an an already playing clip)
     - set to 0: when it does not make sense to re-trigger the already selected pad

Push and hold the lower pad for one of the Groups and use the on-screen knobs to adjust:
* the background color
* the midi channel:  midi channel to send pad events, when -1 will use the global padChan
* the start note:  whether to forward a pad's incoming note (when -1) or else the note to send

You can also use your MIDI keyboard to adjust the color for a 'Group Of Pads' as follows:
* hold down the pad corresponding to the Group
   ** the upper row of pads is used for the foreground color
   ** the lower row of pads is used for the background color. On Arturia you need to switch to Pads bank 8-16.
* while holding down the pad turn the knob corresponding to the 'Group of Pads' to change the color. 
   On Arturia: use the upper row of knobs.


Screen:  PAD Settings

Here you configure the behavior of the 16 LED pads on your MIDI controller. 
(Note that Arturia uses a  special key to switch between keyboard pads 0-7 and 8-16.)

Push and hold one of the pads and use the knobs on-screen to adjust:
* the Group Of Pads that governs this pad's behavior
* sendType: whether this pad sends a note (which is then taken from the 'start note' defined in the Group) or else the CC# to send
* sendUp: when pad has a CC or note associated, 'on' means sending this on 'pad up'
* offMess: when >=0, this is the CC value to send on 'pad up'

Push and hold one of the pads and use the [SHIFT] key on-screen to toggle:
* type:  toggle   or  momentary  - whether the pad turns off when you release it, or toggles between on and off

??? use of keyboard pads to adjust ???
???  - use of the Midi keyboard knob to adjust ???


Screen:  DIALS AND MISC

This configures the behavior of MIDI keyboard's controller knobs and other settings.

The following are global settings for this Configuration Set:
* on-screen knob dialChan: the channel on which the MIDI keyboard's CC knobs will be forwarded
* on-screen knob padChan: the channel on which the MIDI keyboard's pad notes will be forwarded

Hold down one of the on-screen upper pads and use the on-screen knobs to configure:
* the CC controller number to use for forwarding CC messages from the corresponding knob on the MIDI keyboard
* for Arturia, shown as CC2: the CC controller number for the _lower_ row of knobs (8-16) that the owners of this keyboard can use

??? use of keyboard pads to adjust ???
???  - use of the Midi keyboard knob to adjust ???

The pads 'Share to global' and 'Load to global' write and -respectively- read all Configuration Sets to (or from) a shared memory memory space. It could be used to share configuration changes across different instances of the script. (Note: currently the Arturia controller 8-16 message channels will not be saved/restored using this.)

Hit [SHIFT] to return again to the MAIN screen.


3. Examples

[[To be worked out in the future.]]

Sample Script: per video

(( Idea: toggle keyboard betwee different channels (???) ))

Idea: Mixer
   cs1:   volume   -   bypass/not bypass  -  solo exclusive group  => ch 1-8
   cs2:   balance -   open preset - ??
   cs3:     ??different cc settings??    - ...

Idea: Component CCs
     cs1:   cc21-28     (45-52)    - pads??
     cs2:  cc29-36     (53-60)    - ??
     cs3:  cc37-44     (61-68)    - ??
